# Acknowledgements
Thanks to _aculich_ for [his configs](https://github.com/aculich/.emacs.d).
It's very difficult to find any _sane_ configurations in the Emacs world.

# TODO
1. Paredit is trying to be too smart and doesn't allow to delete _unmatched_ left paren, when it was left there by accident.  
1. Moving sexp's around with C-\<arrows\> is a terrible, terrible idea for my muscle memory.
1. Vim's % to move to a closing paren ([solution](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/NavigatingParentheses))
1. Comment/uncomment with C-/ (I think I will be slowly heading towards VSCode controls...)
